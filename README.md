## ✨ Features

*   **Flexible Model Selection:**
    *   Load your own Stable Diffusion 1.5 models (in `diffusers` format) from a local `./checkpoints` directory.
    *   Access a curated list of popular SD1.5 models directly from the app (models are downloaded and cached locally on first use).
*   **Device Agnostic:**
    *   Run inference on your **CPU**.
    *   Leverage your **NVIDIA GPU** for significantly faster generation (requires installing the CUDA-enabled PyTorch version). **The default setup installs the CPU version; instructions are provided to upgrade for GPU users.**
*   **Comprehensive Control:**
    *   **Positive & Negative Prompts:** Guide the AI with detailed descriptions of what you want (and don't want).
    *   **Inference Steps:** Control the number of denoising steps.
    *   **CFG Scale:** Adjust how strongly the image should conform to your prompt.
    *   **Schedulers:** Experiment with different sampling algorithms (Euler, DPM++ 2M, DDPM, LMS).
    *   **Image Sizes:** Choose from standard SD1.5 resolutions, plus a "hire.fix" option (interpreted as 1024x1024).
    *   **Seed Control:** Set a specific seed for reproducible results or use -1 for random generation.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Clean and intuitive Gradio UI.
    *   Organized controls with advanced settings in an accordion for a cleaner look.
    *   Direct image display with download and share options.
*   **Safety First (Note):** The built-in safety checker is **disabled** in this version to allow for maximum creative freedom. Please be mindful of the content you generate.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

*   **Windows Operating System:** The provided batch files (`.bat`) are for Windows. For other operating systems, follow the manual setup steps below.
*   **Python:** 3.8 or higher. Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH (usually an option during installation). You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
*   **Git:** (Required for manual setup and updating) For cloning the repository.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   A modern CPU is required.
    *   For GPU acceleration (optional but highly recommended for speed), a compatible NVIDIA GPU with up-to-date CUDA drivers. At least 6-8GB VRAM is recommended for 512x512 generation, more for larger sizes.
*   **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading models from Hugging Face Hub and for updates.

## 📦 Easy Setup (Windows - Download & Run)

This is the recommended method for most Windows users.

1.  **Download the project:**
    *   Go to the GitHub repository page: `https://github.com/Raxephion/CipherCore-WebUI`
    *   Click the green "Code" button.
    *   Click "Download ZIP".
2.  **Extract the ZIP:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., your Documents folder or Desktop). This will create a folder like `CipherCore-SD1.5-Image-Generator-main` (or similar). Rename it if you prefer.
3.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    *   Navigate into the extracted folder.
    *   Find the file named `setup.bat`.
    *   **Double-click `setup.bat`** to run it.
    *   A command prompt window will open. Follow the instructions in the window. This script will create a Python virtual environment (`venv`), install all necessary core dependencies, and install the **CPU version** of PyTorch by default.
    *   **Important:** Read the output in the command prompt carefully during and after the script finishes. It will provide specific commands if you wish to upgrade PyTorch to the GPU-accelerated CUDA version, which is necessary for fast generation on an NVIDIA GPU. You must run this upgrade command manually if you have a GPU and want to use it.
4.  **Prepare Local Models (Optional):**
    *   Inside the extracted project folder, create a directory named `checkpoints` (if `setup.bat` didn't create it).
    *   Place your Stable Diffusion 1.5 models (in `diffusers` format – meaning each model is a folder containing files like `model_index.json`, `unet/`, `vae/`, etc.) inside the `checkpoints` directory.
        Example structure:
        ```
        YourProjectFolder/
        ├── checkpoints/
        │   ├── my-custom-model-1/
        │   │   ├── model_index.json
        │   │   ├── unet/
        │   │   └── ...
        │   └── another-local-model/
        │       └── ...
        ├── main.py
        ├── requirements.txt
        ├── setup.bat
        ├── run.bat
        ├── update.bat
        ├── images/              <-- This folder should exist
        │   └── ciphercore01.png   <-- Your image file should be here
        └── ...
        ```


## 🔄 Updating the Application (Windows - Easy Method)

To get the latest code, dependency updates and updated models from this repository after using the easy setup:

*   Navigate to the project folder.
*   Find the file named `update.bat`.
*   **Double-click `update.bat`** to run it.
*   A command prompt window will open and pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository and upgrade the Python packages in your virtual environment.
*   **Important:** This assumes you have not made local changes that conflict with the repository updates. If `git pull` fails, you may need to handle merge conflicts manually or discard local changes.


## ▶️ Running the Application (Windows - Easy Method)

Once the setup is complete, launch the Gradio web UI by double-clicking the `run.bat` file in the project folder.

*   A command prompt window will open, activate the environment, and start the application.
*   A browser window should automatically open to the application (or a local URL will be provided in the console, usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
